From the [previous post](https://3seoksw.github.io/blog/2024/venv/), we've seen how to set up a virtual environment with Python's [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
In this post, we will be taking a look at how to set up a Python developing environment with [`conda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/) when you're dealing with complex environments.
The `venv` is great enough when you're developing a simple program or web application, in my opinion.
However, if you're trying to develop data science-related things, AI models, or such, I believe it is much easier to use `conda`, since `conda` is able to create multiple Python environments with specific Python versions.

You can either install `anaconda` or `miniconda` (both are `conda`) based on your preference.
I am using [`miniconda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#) since it's much lighter than the `anaconda`.
Either way, it works the same way, the only difference between those two is just `anaconda` comes with various pre-installed packages so it might be a little bulky.

### Installation

This [page](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) shows how to install `miniconda` with command line scripts.

After the installation, every command will start with `conda`.
When `conda` command not found is displayed, make sure to add environment variable into your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

```zsh
# ~/.zshrc (or .bashrc)
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
```

If the terminal displays `(base)`, you're all set.

### Creating a new virtual environment

You can simply create a new `conda` environment with the following command.

```zsh
conda create --name <env-name> python=<version>
```

### Activating

After creating a new virtual environment, you can activate the one as follows:

```zsh
conda activate <env-name>
```

Then, the name of the virtual environment from the terminal will change from `(base)` to `(env-name)`.

To verify whether the environment is reall ready, try `which python` and see if the result is something like `~/miniconda3/envs/<env-name>/bin/python`.

### Installing packages

It is always a good practice to use `requirements.txt` file.
As described from the [previous post](https://3seoksw.github.io/blog/2024/venv/), using `pip-tools` will make your life much easier.

From this step, you can follow the steps of [last post's package installation steps](https://3seoksw.github.io/blog/2024/venv/#installing-packages).
