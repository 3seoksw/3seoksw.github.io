I am currently a Senior Computer Science undergraduate student at the [Sangmyung University](https://cs.smu.ac.kr/cs/index.do), with an expected graduation in February 2025.
Since June 2023, I have been working as an undergraduate research intern under [Dr. KyungSeop Shin](https://cs.smu.ac.kr/cs/faculty/faculty.do?mode=view&empNo=10881398&pager.offset=0&pagerLimit=20)'s [Network Information Systems Lab](https://nisl.smu.ac.kr) focusing on the study of **Reinforcement Learning** (RL).

The areas that I'm interested in are: **Decision-making Systems**, **Robotics**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Applied Machine Learning**.
