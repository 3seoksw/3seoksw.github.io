Imagin you’re using a large language model like Chat-GPT, and you ask some question to the model then you’ve probably gotten a passive answer at first. Then you had to refine your instruction since the model’s initial answer wasn’t satisfactory and repeat this process multiple times, which is quite frustrating experience and consumes a lot of time. This largely comes from how most models are trained and optimized for single-turn helpfulness, which encourages passive responses and ultimately limits long-term interaction. COLLABLLM aims for a more interactive, multiturn-based experience. To address the aforementioned problems, COLLABLLM introduces two ideas which are Collaborative simulation and a Multiturn-aware Reward which is called MR. Together, these make the model more proactive and lead to higher task performance and better interactivity across multiple turns.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/COLLABLLM/comp_collabllm-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/COLLABLLM/comp_collabllm-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/COLLABLLM/comp_collabllm-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/COLLABLLM/comp_collabllm.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 1. Comparisons between existing LLMs and COLLABLLM. <d-cite key="collabllm"></d-cite> </div> <h2 id="overview-of-collabllm">Overview of COLLABLLM</h2> <p>The following figure shows the overall process of how COLLABLLM works.</p> <p>For instance, the user gives an instruction to the model asking to write about how optimism can improve our well-being. Given the context state x, the model outputs a response y from the policy pi. What differs from other models is that instead of giving the answer right away, it asks more contextual questions like what kind of tone are you aiming for.</p> <p>The way model is not giving you passive answer, rather asking contextual questions is possible because the model is using multiturn-aware reward function to ensure model is accounting for multiturn. Also, making the model be aware of future turns is done by using collaborative simulation to see what would the future conversation be like.</p> <p>Collaborative simulation is to sample future conversations given the context state. You can think of collaborative simulation as a conversation lookahead method between user and the model. However, it is impossible to know what would users ask in near future, and even corresponding replies to unknown user’s future input.</p> <p>To make this feasible for enabling lookahead of conversations, a simulated user such as GPT 4o that imitates the actual user generates user’s future input. In collaborative simulation, forward sampling is used to retrieve unknown future dialogue between the user and the model. Ultimately, this enables the model take future conversation into account and choose responses aligned with a long-term goal, instead of a current-focused goal.</p> <p>Finally, they apply reinforcement learning fine-tuning such as SFT, PPO, and DPO using the MR function.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/COLLABLLM/framework-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/COLLABLLM/framework-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/COLLABLLM/framework-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/COLLABLLM/framework.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 2.

These issues are due to the insufficient extraction and reasoning of visual knowledge. In other words, the existing models struggle from region-level tasks.</p> <p>To tackle this problem, the paper proposes the LION model. The objective of the model is to inject two levels of visual knowledge, which are image-level and region-level understanding. To make this possible, the model incorporates fine-grained spatial-aware knowledge, and applies soft prompting of high-level semantic visual evidence. These two enable the MLLM  to capture both global and local visual information from a given image.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/LION_MLLM_comp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/LION_MLLM_comp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/LION_MLLM_comp-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/LION_MLLM_comp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 1.</i> Comparison between existing MLLMs and LION <a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p> <h2 id="related-works--visual-grounding">Related Works – Visual Grounding</h2> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/bbox_rep-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/bbox_rep-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/bbox_rep-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/bbox_rep.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 2.</i> Representation of object description and bounding box which follows Markdown link format <a href="#2">[1]</a>. </p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/kosmos-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/kosmos-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/kosmos-2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/kosmos-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Figure 3.

Kosmos-2 converts existing datasets into a Markdown-style link format. This format represents a bounding box which includes spatial coordinates enclosed in square brackets as shown in Figure 2 and 3.</p> <p>The reason this Markdown link format matters is that it provides a tokenizer-friendly representation, making it easier for the model to understand both the semantic meaning of the image tags and their spatial locations. In this way, it effectively bridges the gap between text and visual grounding tasks. However, the Kosmos-2 still fall short in handling broader aspect of visual tasks beyond region-level grounding.</p> <h2 id="method">Method</h2> <h3 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/lion_overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 4.</i> Overview of LION <a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p> <h3 id="spatial-visual-knowledge">Spatial Visual Knowledge</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/lion_spatial-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/lion_spatial-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/lion_spatial-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/lion_spatial.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 5.</i> Representation of how LION handle spatial visual knowledge <a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p> <p>To incorporate spatial-aware visual knowledge into the model, the paper suggests reformatting the datasets into a unified format, that combines natural language descriptions and object coordinates enclosed in square brackets for instruction tuning, just like Kosmos-2 did.</p> <p>Still, it remains two main internal conflicts when the model tries to learn both image-level and region-level visual tasks. One is the need of region-level modality-alignment pre-training. This is because most MLLMs are only trained with global image features. And the second is the gap between the input-output modes of image-level and region level visual tasks. As mentioned earlier, the reformatted data contains text and coordinates, which can confuse the model when trained together.</p> <p>To address these two conflicts, a stage-wise instruction tuning strategy is applied, which is a three-stage training strategy.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Image-level For the first stage, the model learns general vision-language understanding, by fine-tuning the Q-Former and the image-level adapter in the LLM. This offers the model with image-level knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Region-level And for the second stage, the model focuses on fine-grained spatial knowledge, by using a vision aggregator to capture detailed visual features along with the region-level adapter. At this stage, the model learns more about region-level knowledge, and as the model is trained on region-level AFTER the image-level, it can avoid severe interference between the two levels.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mixture of the both Finally at the third stage, the model combines the outputs from the previous two stages using a router, which dynamically balances image-level and region-level knowledge. The key component here is the router. The router not only balances between the two levels of knowledge, but also aligns the input-output mismatch by assigning adaptive weights to each adapters’ output based on the task type.</p> </li> </ol> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/stage-wise_instruction-tuning-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/stage-wise_instruction-tuning-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/stage-wise_instruction-tuning-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/LION/stage-wise_instruction-tuning.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 6.</i> The stage-wise instruction-tuning strategy <a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p> \[\begin{align*} O^t = F(X) + \sum_{k=1}^{K=2}G_k^t \odot H_k(X), \end{align*}\] <p>where \(H_k(X)\) is an adapter for \(k\)-th adapter and \(F(X)\) is the output of FFN.</p> <p>To make the stage-wise instruction possible, we must first look at the placement of the adapters in the LLM.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
