I am a Master's student in Computer Science specializing in Data Science at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/scs/),
joined [iML](https://iml.carleton.ca/) as a Research Assistant, where I am currently studying **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)** under the supervision of [Dr. Majid Komeili](https://carleton.ca/scs/people/majid-komeili/).
My current interests are **LLM Alignment**, **Preference Optimization**, and **Applied Machine Learning**.

Before entering Carleton University, from June 2023 to February 2025, I worked as an undergraduate research intern in [Dr. KyungSeop Shin](https://cs.smu.ac.kr/cs/faculty/faculty.do?mode=view&empNo=10881398&pager.offset=0&pagerLimit=20)'s [Network Information Systems Lab](https://nisl.smu.ac.kr), where I focused on applying **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to networking systems.
My past research interest areas were: **Decision-making Systems**, **Roboticsf**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Applied Machine Learning**.
