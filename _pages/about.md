I am a Master's student in Computer Science specializing in Data Science at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/scs/).
From June 2023 to February 2025, I worked as an undergraduate research intern in [Dr. KyungSeop Shin](https://cs.smu.ac.kr/cs/faculty/faculty.do?mode=view&empNo=10881398&pager.offset=0&pagerLimit=20)'s [Network Information Systems Lab](https://nisl.smu.ac.kr), where I focused on applying **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to networking systems.
After graduating from [Sangmyung University](https://www.smu.ac.kr/eng1/index.do), I joined [iML](https://iml.carleton.ca/) at Carleton University, where I am currently studying **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** under the supervision of [Dr. Majid Komeili](https://carleton.ca/scs/people/majid-komeili/).

My past research interest areas were: **Decision-making Systems**, **Robotics**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Applied Machine Learning**.
More importantly, my current interests are **Big Data Management** and **Computer Vision Application (or Machine Vision)**.
