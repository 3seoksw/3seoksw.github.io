For image-level tasks, image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) are performed. For region-level task, visual grounding (locating the target object) is performed. </p> <h2 id="limitations-of-the-previous-work">Limitations of the Previous Work</h2> <p>Two main concerns in the original work were identified which motivated the project method.</p> <p>First is that the model’s high reliance on the off-the-shelf vision models, especially RAM. Image-level tasks are heavily dependent on the RAM’s performance, as image tags generated by RAM are typically imperfect. Also, this RAM-dependent architecture is the point where the authors pointed out as a limitations from the paper, which would eventually cause object hallucination.</p> <p>Second is that the model relies on the soft prompting technique. Although there are some studies have conducted experiments with soft prompting, it is believed that its capabilities are still requiring more exploration, and its not yet fully established technique. These limitations inspired us to propose our method called dynamic soft prompting.</p> <h2 id="method">Method</h2> <p>Building on the limitations, the solution seems relatively straightforward. What if instead of relying on this static soft prompt solution, we changed it to a more dynamic solution?</p> <p>  Instead of using a single frozen vector for every image, we built a pipeline that generates a unique, context-aware prompt embedding for every single input.</p> <p>  We can break down our approach into 3 different stages: First, we extract the tags and their respective confidence scores from the image using RAM Second, we use a fine-tuned BERT model to convert those tags into meaningful embeddings And third, we project and feed those embeddings into the lion model’s architecture</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/lion_overview-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/LION/lion_overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 2.</i> The dynamic soft prompt generation process <a href="#1">[1]</a>. </p> <h3 id="bert-pipeline">BERT Pipeline</h3> <p>Taking a look at the BERT pipeline, the first step was to build a dataset to train BERT. So first, we modified the authors’ RAM code to not only extract tags, but also their confidence scores. The idea behind this is that it provides extra information for BERT to understand the importance of tags. For the dynamic prompt generation, we’re giving more importance to objects that the model is certain about and less attention to objects that could be hallucinations.</p> <p>When it comes to the captions, our original dataset contained 5 captions per image. Since we only need one caption to decide which to pick, we chose to compute the average embedding of the captions using Sentence Transformer and pick the caption that is closest to this centroid. The idea behind this method is that this caption will likely be the most representative of the image itself and provide the most useful information.</p> <p>So now that we have our tag string and our sentence embeddings, we can feed them all to our Triplet Margin Loss function. For this loss function, we must first define an anchor, a positive example and a negative example. For our particular dataset, the tag string was the anchor, and we defined the correct caption as the positive and a random caption as the negative.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/bert_pipeline-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/bert_pipeline-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/bert_pipeline-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/LION/bert_pipeline.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 3.</i> BERT Pipeline. </p> <h3 id="fine-tuning-bert">Fine-Tuning BERT</h3> \[\begin{align*} L(a, p, n) = max(d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + margin, 0), \end{align*}\] <p>where \(d(x_i, y_i) = \lVert x_i - y_i \rVert_p\).</p> <ul> <li>Anchor: BERT([tags + scores])</li> <li>Positive: \(Avg(BERT([image captions]))\)</li> <li>Negative: \(Avg(BERT([image captions]_{neg}))\), unrelated captions used</li> </ul> <h3 id="parameter-efficient-fine-tuning">Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</h3> <p>Another crucial change we considered was to use this technique called Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Essentially, we are keeping most of the T5 parameters frozen, which includes the vision encoder and the Flan-T5 backbone. We only calculated gradients for other components, such as the dynamic prompt projection layer, the fusion adapter, and vision language components. We even applied differential learning rates, where we applied a much higher learning rate for our new projection layer to help learn faster. Since this new layer is initialized with random weights, it requires a much larger gradient update to converge quickly. The idea behind this is to avoid retraining the entire model, which would be computationally expensive. By freezing, we can take advantage of the pre-trained components that are already good at their job and just focus on training anything involved with the new additions.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/peft-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/peft-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/peft-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/LION/peft.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 4.</i> Pipeline of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). </p> <h2 id="experiment">Experiment</h2> <h3 id="setup">Setup</h3> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/exp_setup-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/exp_setup-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/exp_setup-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/LION/exp_setup.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Table 1.</i> Comparison of models for experimental setup. </p> <h3 id="bert-fine-tuning">BERT Fine-Tuning</h3> <p>Now, looking at some of our results, let’s first take a look at our Triplet Margin Loss performed for our BERT model. So, what are these graphs telling us? Well, on the left, we can see a steady decrease in loss for both our training and validation. This is the first evidence that our model is learning and that our loss function works. The second piece of evidence can be found on this graph on the right. Here we are looking at the cosine similarity measured across both our training and validation sets. What this is telling us is that the anchors or the tag string are very similar to the image caption. And remember a score of 1 means that the vectors are pointing in the same direction, 0 means that the vectors are orthogonal (or perpendicular), and -1 means opposite. Our results show that anchor-positive pairs are getting scores of around 0.8, and anchor-negative pairs are getting scores of less than 0.2. What this effectively means is that this massive gap confirms that the push-pull loss function worked well and was able to create a distinct, separated embedding for the correct image context.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/LION/exp_bert-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/LION/exp_bert-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/LION/exp_bert-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/LION/exp_bert.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p align="center"> <i>Figure 5.</i> Training result of fine-tuning the BERT model used for dynamic soft prompt generation.
