  abstract = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each
              element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a
              physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with
              certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in
              the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting
              operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the
              other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave
              function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two
              quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the
              problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of
              measurements made on another system that had previously interacted
              with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also
              false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality
              as given by a wave function is not complete.},
