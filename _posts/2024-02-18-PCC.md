**Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)** is a statistic method of measuring linear correlation between two sets of data.

### Definition

Say $$r_{xy}$$ is representing a PCC between two variables, $$x$$ and $$y$$. Then, $$r_{xy}$$ is defined as:

$$
r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}}
$$

where $n$ is sample size, $$x_i, y_i$$ are the samples with the index number of $$i$$, $$\bar{x}$$ is the sample mean and analogously for $$\bar{y}$$.
The $$r_{xy}$$ is in the range of $$[-1, 1]$$. As the value gets closer to 1, it represents a strong linear correlation. And conversely when it gets near to -1, it means the two are inversely proportional. Finally, if it is 0, then there is no correlation.

The above equation can also be expressed as follows:

$$
r_{xy} = \frac{cov(x, y)}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$

where $$cov$$ is covariance, and $$\sigma$$ is standard deviation.
